This is a sample project for using NRF8001 module from Adafruit. See the example project, but basically:

Add NRF8001.h/m and NRF8001Delegate.h/m

Add [NRF8001 sharedInstance] to AppDelegate.m

Make your ViewController a delegate for NRF8001Delegate

Implement the delegate fns

Receive and send data to the module - Use the BLE Echo example from adafruit as a starting point.
